In constest scoring, there are three altitudes to consider:

GPS altitude: comes from the GPS receiver, not accurate, only used as backup.

Pressure altitude:  Comes from the pressure transducer in the recorder.  As the recorder has no "Kollsman" knob, this can vary based on atmospheric pressure.

Corrected altitude:  This is the pressure altude which has been "corrected" to correctly show an accurate altitude above MSL.  Think of this as setting the altimeter to the field elevation before flight.  The correction is created at takeoff time based on the home field elevation and is used for start gate and airspace altitude checking.  For finish gate altitude checks, a 2nd correction is made based on landing at the home field.  The most favorable of these two correction is used for finish penalities.

I checked your day 3 flight log (July 2).  I didn't see a corrected altitude issue, but I did see a speed issue.  Maybe if you flew faster you would have won the day.
