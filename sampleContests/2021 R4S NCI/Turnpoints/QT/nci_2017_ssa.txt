* The Class B, C, and D airspace information in this file is composed of       <
* computed approximations of the arcs and lines that make up various airspace  <
* boundaries that have been derived from lists of points along those boundaries.<
* The point data has been taken from the Federal Aviation Administration       <
* National Airspace System Resource (NASR) geospatial information files as     <
* published by the National Flight Data Center.  Errors in the computed        <
* positions of the boundaries themselves will generally be less than 300 feet  <
* (although errors in the estimated positions of arc center points and radii   <
* might be much larger); however, any of the following factors may cause errors<
* to be greater:                                                               <
